    <h1>Agent Workspace Maturity Model</h1>

    <p>
      As contact centers adopt richer desktop solutions called "workspaces," enterprises 
      should evaluate their needs against key considerations. This maturity model from 
      Coral allows assessment of your current situation and future needs. Key factors 
      include consolidating applications into a single pane of glass for efficiency; 
      customizing experiences for different roles and segments; leveraging automation technologies 
      like RPA, workflows, and orchestration to boost productivity; providing AI assistance 
      to agents; ensuring user adoption with agile, incremental updates; and enabling 
      gradual migration to the cloud. Assessing these elements will position you to 
      deliver excellent customer experiences.
